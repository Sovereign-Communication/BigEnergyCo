# Master plan amendments

Append-only log of changes to `docs/plan/MASTER_PLAN.md` (see §16 of the
plan). Each entry chains the plan's SHA-256 from the adopted genesis hash to
the hash pinned in `docs/plan/PLAN.lock.json`; `npm run plan:check` rejects a
broken chain, a missing approver, or any rewrite of an earlier entry.

No amendments yet: the plan is at its genesis hash.

## A-001: Carry-forward from the P0.2 review, and current-state gaps

- Date: 2026-09-26
- Approved-by: @Treystu
- Plan-SHA256-before: ee27dbd42166352f4dcda832e611c9dc5c7fa4759f332a0d3a91319f18003ec6
- Plan-SHA256-after: cf0ab98e006b462259cce491a956bd27c5cadb8a09f2d8f2badf53d0d9d42ed2
- Sections: Q-07; §6.2 Step 5; §6.4 recommended system; R-AI-02a (new); R-DS-03; F-44, F-45 (new); R-SEO-07 (new); §7 (map-provider.js); P0.3(e); P0.5; P6.1; P6.7; P8.3; P10.3; O-09 (new); §13.3; §14
- Rationale: The P0.2 carry-forward review (PR #146) found four shipped behaviours the plan did not pin. The owner approved in chat on 2026-09-26: (a) race safety for Jev/advisor requests (new R-AI-02a); (b) touch targets raised from 44 px to the 48 px already shipped; (c) muted/secondary text contrast of at least 5.5:1; (d) Simple/Technical mode kept. On the roof-drawing map the owner chose to retire roof limits entirely: the roof-space input, the roof-drawing map (`map-provider.js`, which loads Leaflet from a CDN) and the roof constraint on the recommended system are removed, and the footprint stays informational. The current-state review also found two gaps: F-44, the production domain returns HTTP 403 with a Cloudflare challenge (verified 2026-09-26; release ledger probes agree), closed by new R-SEO-07 and owner action O-09; and F-45, hand-maintained, stale live-Jev evidence (reported in PR #149), closed in P0.3(e). §13.3 now names `SCOPE_FACETS` as the scope map and requires fresh evidence.
